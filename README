
A remote procedure call (RPC) is an inter-process communication that allows a computer program to cause a subroutine or procedure to execute in another address space 
(commonly on another computer on a shared network) without the programmer explicitly coding the details for this remote interaction

Steps:

1>> compiling the .x file with rpcgen
	
	rpcgen ll.x

2>> compiling the server file

	cc -o server llservice.c ll_svc.c ll_xdr.c

3>> compiling the client file

	cc -o client llclient.c ll_clnt.c ll_xr.c

4>> running the server

	./server

5>> running the client

	./client <server ip> <input data elements>
